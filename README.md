# Noah's Book Search Engine
Challenge 21

## Description
During this project I demonstrated my understanding of RESTful API's and GraphQL API's, as I refactored a RESTful API into a GraphQL one built with Apollo Server. I proved that I understand the MERN stack, with a React frontend, MongoDB database backend, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
I also proved that I understand what GraphQL queries and mutations are and how they can be used to fetch and modify data, and that I can use Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server. Other specifications were also required with making this application, like implementing auth.js, setting up a server.js file with middleware, creating a schemas directory, and creating various .jsx files.

## Installation
This application is supposed to be deployed on Heroku.

## Usage
This application is used by the user to search a term and be able to find certain books that correlate to that term. The user is able to save certain books by clicking a "Save this book!" button, and they can also view all of their saved items on a separate page. When viewing a specific book, the user can view the title, authors, and a description piece of text about the book.
